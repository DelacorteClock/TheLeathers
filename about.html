                    What I Do In Addition To Programming

                    (Note: This part is very poor quality for now because I know that this is optionalâ€¦I just
                    wanted to include it just in case one of my employers was interested in hiring me because
                    of one of my extra interests. I want to add transitions and make it more story-like
                    in the future.) I ride trains and buses for pleasure and travel. I make animated
                    films. I make paintings. I make virtual 2D art. I design virtual sculptures. I visit museums.
                    I make films with architectural and transport photography. I draw clothing designs for pleasure.
                    I buy and wear fashion forwards clothing made from leather and vinyl. I ensure that my hair is
                    always painted an interesting colour. I travel by tricycle because I cannot balance too well. I
                    cook many sorts of food. I love teaching and education and taught students in educational clubs.
                    I love to make films with toy vehicles with my sister. I know how to operate railway locomotives.
                    I like to learn about architectural history. I plan to earn an architecture degree.
                    My current 'pleasure' goals are to operate a real locomotive for the first time, learn how to manufacture
                    fashion pieces and (in the distant future) learn how to operate a bus.
